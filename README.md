# Personal Website â€” Ektider

This repository contains the source code for my personal website: [ektider.com](https://ektider.com).

The site is built using the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme, originally created by [alshedivat](https://github.com/alshedivat).  
I made several edits and adjustments with the help of ChatGPT and DeepSeek.

Iâ€™m not an expert in either coding or web development â€” some parts of the code might be unnecessary or clumsy, but the site works.

If Iâ€™ve unintentionally violated any GitHub, coding, or open-source norms, please know itâ€™s purely due to a lack of knowledge, not intention.

ðŸŽ¥ Reference: [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFkeOBqfQBw) is what made me concerned about proper practices.
