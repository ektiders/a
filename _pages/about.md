السلام عليكم


I'm a Junior at [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/), majoring in `Economics` with a minor in `Mathematics`.

Currently, I work as a `Teaching Assistant` in the Department of Mathematics and Physics, NSU.

I don't use any social media, so I’ll be sharing my insights and works here.

To take a dive into my thoughts and works, keep an eye here. I will keep you posted here.
