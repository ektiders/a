السلام عليكم


I'm a Junior at [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu/), majoring in `Economics` with a minor in `Mathematics`.

Currently, I work as a `Teaching Assistant` in the Department of Mathematics and Physics, NSU.

Outside academics, I’m an endurance runner. My longest run so far is 25 km, completed at the `Dhaka 25K` in 2025 in 2.42 hours.
